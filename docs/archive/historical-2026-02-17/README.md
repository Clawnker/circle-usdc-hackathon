# Historical Archive (2026-02-17)

These documents were moved out of the active `docs/` surface to keep the current architecture/release docs clean.

They are retained for reference and auditability.

## Archived groups
- Legacy sprint QA/test reports (`QA_SPRINT*`, `PRODUCTION_TEST_REPORT.md`)
- Prior planning artifacts (`REFACTOR_PLAN.md`, `TEAM_TASKS_PLAN.md`)
- Legacy version-track docs (`V2_*`, `V3-SCOPE.md`)

If any archived document becomes relevant again, move it back to `docs/` and re-link from the main README.
