# Phase 4 Kanban Snapshot (2026-02-17)

## Todo
- Sprint 4 continuation: tune routing/latency thresholds based on smoke failure slices

## In Progress
- Real-user phrase calibration against release-gate prompt set (latency + routing stability)

## Done (this cycle)
- Routing eval harness + precision tests
- Routing fast-path/fallback improvements (sentiment/trade/multi-hop edge cases)
- Response readability fallback formatter + tests
- x402 frontend payment fetch reliability hardening
- Sprint 4.4 complete: network-mode toggle UX (sticky mode + explicit badges + route/dispatch threading + wrong-network guards)
- Sprint 4.5 complete: release-gate smoke scripts with latency budget and failure-slice summaries
- Backend tests + backend build + frontend build
- Live prod health/route-preview checks
